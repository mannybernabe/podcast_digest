Short Wave,The Key To Uncovering An Ancient Maya City? Lasers,14 minutes,"Fri, 18 Aug 2023 04:10:15 +0000","In this podcast episode, the hosts discuss the recently discovered lost city of Occam Tune in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, and how it is changing our understanding of the ancient Maya civilization. The city was found using laser technology, specifically LiDAR, which allowed researchers to map the area and uncover hidden structures. The discovery challenges previous assumptions about the harshness of the landscape and the population size of the ancient Maya. Occam Tune may have been inhabited for as long as 1700 years and could have had a larger population than previously estimated. The findings also shed light on the sustainable agricultural practices of the ancient Maya and the threats they faced, such as warfare and climate change. Excavations are yet to be carried out, but more discoveries are expected in the future.",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2022/09/23/short-wave_tile_npr-network-01_sq-517382b4b8fd0ab48ea9c781253f9992eab733dc.jpg?s=1400&c=66&f=jpg
